Determine the first and last points of intersection：
1.Calculate the intersection of the ray with the first and last height planes；
2.Converting intersections to latitude and longitude altitude coordinates；
3.Exclude invalid points based on grid range；
4.If both intersections are null points define the ray is a null ray；
5.Record whether the ray is a valid ray with a boolean variable；
6.Save the latitude, longitude and altitude coordinates of valid intersection points；
7.Determine the range of each valid segmentation plane (rounding down and rounding up)；

Projection Matrix Generation Steps：
1.Iterate over the valid segmentation points in the three directional planes and compute the coordinates of the intersection points；
2.Check if each intersection point is within the range of a valid segmentation plane and get its column index；
3.Integrate all valid intersections and convert intersections to xyz coordinates；
4.Sort the distances to get the intersection matrix after distance ascension；
5.Calculate the ID index of each intersection point in all three directions in the grid；
6.Convert the 3D numbering of each intersection point to 1D numbering；
7.The projection matrix is generated by assigning the distance values corresponding to the one-dimensional numbers to the positions in the corresponding vectors；
